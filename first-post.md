I wanted to make a devlog of what I am doing on this game.
Probably will end up being just for me but that's fine. I want to write more anyway.
I also have thought about doing a video devlog like you see on YouTube all the time. Maybe I still will, but editing seems like a lot of work. Writing with no purpose it much easier

### The Game

I am working on a game based off a story I got me 5 year old neice to tell. It's not anything groundbreaking I just thought it would be fun an cute.
It is going to be a, hopefully, small game. Top down turn based combat RPG thing. So akin to Pok√©mon et al. I don't think I am very good at game design so it remains to be seen if it will be any fun.

### Details

So I am building this game mostly from scratch (at least no engine) in the programming langauge [Odin](https://odin-lang.org). It's a neat little systems programming langauage similar in goals to C.
Odin is fun and pretty easy to learn while having a lot of power. I would have made this game in C++ but a mostly C style if I wasn't using Odin. Mostly I think engine and low level stuff is fun to work on.

For windowing stuff and lower level graphics stuff I am using [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com). It is small and easy to use. Meant more twoard beginners but I am one in a lot of ways. I compile raylib as a static library and link it as a foreign interface in Odin. Oding makes foreign stuff pretty easy. I wrote my foreign code mostly myself. There are existing bindings for Oding someone wrote. But I thought I would learn more doing it myself and they were a bit out of date. 

My art ideas have been to draw the art with pen and paper and scan the images in then small touch ups in Photoshop. I think it looks fun. You can see the texture of where the pen was etc. Plus making animations with it has this imperfect moving quality to it that makes it look almost like it's a flipbook animation. I dig the style and I have an easier time drawing dumb stuff in a sketch book than on a computer. Not that I could say I am good at either anyway.

I'll link some screenshots or something here:
